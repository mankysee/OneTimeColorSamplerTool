It's a simple one-button Krita docker for alternate COlor Sampler Tool behaviour: This one is switching to Brush tool right after releasing a mouse or tablet press(i.e. kinda like a Procreate behaviour) to better suit all the touch oriented scenarios so you wouldn't need to switch to Brush tool every time you pick a color manually.
